#the grey area are the ones for the code. They can have a name, so it can be easier to identify where potential errors originated.
#can make more grey chunks by copy/pasting the grey lines

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
      #"cars" is the name of the code chunk

If want to write smth like "The mean speed of all cars is 15.4" don't do it like this
Instead use the code: The mean speed of all cars is `r mean(cars$speed)`.

#For inlay code: `summary(cars)`

#alternate code: ```{r warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, echo=FALSE}      
```{r cars}   
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
